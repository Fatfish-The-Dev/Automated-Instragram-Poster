At the moment it’s just a few values - today’s calorie count, today’s weight, today’s did I go to the gym - but that’s subject to change…… and in JSON can put objects with any number of key-value pairs - doesn’t have to follow a set schema unlike what you’d in a table document i.e. excel )…… if need to update later to store in a more fitting file format I can do that then"
