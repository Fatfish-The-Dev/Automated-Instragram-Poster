## Introduction

Purpose / Problem Statement: Will be using this tool daily to post to Instagram about how I'm doing with regards to my 2024 goals ( as a means to keep myself accountable - knowing that others are aware of my progress )

Approach: This will be something I do in phases ( i.e. first phase will just be creating something that posts something - can be anything -> next phase will be tweaking it so that it posts stuff that I want it to -> etc ) … each phase will just have only what’s necessary / bare-bones to do what I want it to ( so as to not have any unnecessary clutter )  

## Features

- Saving to a File so that i can keep track of the data i input everyday
- Posting on Instagramm when provided inputs
- Feature 3
